===============================
Panda Bear Database Release 0.0
===============================

Big Goal!
=========
Panda Bear is just an idea in my head. The big goal for release 0.0 is to effectively communicate the ideals and direction of the project so others can work on it. I know a great bunch of people and I would love to get them involved.

Deliverables
============
Since the goal of release 0.0 is to establish and communicate the Panda Bear database Ideology this release will be vaporware. That's right! We're not going to have a database in our first release. Instead we want to deliver documents to ensure the success of the code we eventually write.

Personal Responsibilities
-------------------------
This document will spell out the different roles of individuals in the project and what is expected of them. We don't anticipate to fill all of these roles with different people. A realistic goal would be to have ANYONE else fill any of the roles. However, we do want to spell out the structure of responsibilities so we can grow into them when necessary. At first, each person on the project will need to fill several roles. But if you're involved in open source what's stopping you from doing several jobs at once :-).

This document will be held in the docs folder and maintained by the Benevolent Dictator.

Code Structure
--------------
This document will spell out how we organize our code and what individuals files are. The idea is to communicate the higher level views so that ambitious individuals can move ahead and add the files and code in the correct places when necessary.

Release Decision Process
------------------------
This document will spell out how we decide what features go into each revision. Since a goal of release 0.0 is to define functional specifications for releases 0.1-0.4 the initial decision making processes for those releases will fall outside of this document. However, we want to establish a rythm and routine for making sure we're working towards the correct goals and communicating them to the greater community.

Contributors
------------
This document spells out how people can contribute to our cause.

Functional Specifications for Releases 0.1-0.4
----------------------------------------------
These releases are going to require a lot of work. The goal with these documents is to spell out what will go into each revision so people have an understanding where we are going. This also enables people to contribute in a helpful manner.

Logo
----
We need a logo. Probably some sort of Panda Bear. Someone recently told me the key to a successful open source project is having a cute logo.

Create a Website
----------------
I registered pandabeardatabase.com. We need to create a framework for compiling our documents with sphinx and moving the files to the website.

Decisions
=========

Decide on an Open Source License
--------------------------------
This is self-explanatory.
